## Project Brief

- **Project**: PR1AS
- **Goal**: Full‑stack marketplace platform connecting **Clients** and **Workers**, with secure wallet/escrow, rich worker profiles, booking/transactions, and powerful admin tools.
- **Scope (platform)**:
  - Core flows (auth, worker profiles, wallet & escrow, admin, i18n) are implemented and documented in `MEMORY_BANK.md` (v1.0, production‑ready).
  - Database, API routes, and frontend architecture follow the patterns described in that document.
- **Current Session Scope**:
  - No specific feature is in progress until the user defines a new task.
  - This Memory Bank exists to make it easy to resume work after resets by pointing to the right docs and code entry points.
- **Key Reference Docs**:
  - High level: `MEMORY_BANK.md`
  - Feature & implementation notes: `docs/` and `progess/`
